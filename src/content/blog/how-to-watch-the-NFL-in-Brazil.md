## Brazil's Internet Speeds
Watching NFL games across the country of Brazil is pretty easy to do thanks to their high internet speeds. In the city of Sao Paulo, residents can have access to 1GB fiber lines for $100 USD per month or a MUCH cheaper 500 Mbps for ~$20 per month with [Vivo](https://internet.vivo.com.br/ofertas/fibra/).

## The Two Options We Know Of
1. Purchase NFL Game Pass via DAZN (~$75 USD for the entire season!)
2. Use a VPN and connect to the USA to use your existing subscription
3. Have Another Option? [Contact Us](/contact).

## VPN Option

This one is straight forward if you already have a provider - like DirectTV, YouTubeTV, etc...

Purchase access to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and connect to the city nearest your home residence. This is important because some of these services try to weed out the VPN servers and block them from accessing their services. If you have problems with a specific connection, try to change to another VPN connection and see what happens. Incognito window works well too.
