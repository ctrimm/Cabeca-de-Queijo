As 2025 winds down and the Packers gear up for an intense showdown with their long-time rivals, the Chicago Bears, let’s take a look at the most significant stories from the past week surrounding Green Bay football.

## Roster Moves and Injuries
On December 1, the Packers made several key roster adjustments. Receiver [Will Sheppard](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/green-bay-packers-news/75735/green-bay-packers-announce-3-injury-list-players-will-open-practice-window) was waived from the 53-man roster, making room as the team opened practice windows for injured players, including Devonte Wyatt (ankle injury, now on injured reserve), MarShawn Lloyd, and defensive ends Brenton Cox Jr. and Collin Oliver. Sheppard previously sat on the practice squad before activation due to a series of injuries affecting other receivers like Matthew Golden and Jayden Reed.

Meanwhile, the Packers also signed cornerback [Shemar Bartholomew](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/green-bay-packers-news/75772/packers-bears-game-flexed-to-saturday-night-for-week-16) to the practice squad after releasing cornerback Tyron Herring and wide receiver Michael Woods II. These moves signify that the Packers are focusing on depth at critical positions as they head into the closing stretch of the season.

## Power Rankings and Playoff Push
The Packers are climbing back up various power rankings, landing at #4 in *USA Today* and #5 in publications like *NFL.com, ESPN,* and *CBS Sports*. Their performance [against the Lions](https://packerstalk.com/2025/12/02/fourth-down-fuels-green-bay-packers-victory/) showcased their resilience, as they won 31-24, with Jordan Love throwing for four touchdowns.

Analysts are particularly impressed by Love's play under pressure, noting he leads quarterbacks in nearly every clutch metric over the past month ([Packers Pulse](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/green-bay-packers-news/75761/packers-power-rankings-green-bay-back-in-the-top-5-week-14)). This winning streak is crucial at this point in December, as the Packers (now at 8-3-1) look to solidify their playoff position.

## Bears Rivalry Heating Up
The upcoming matchup against the Bears, set for December 7, is drawing extra attention, especially with both teams in the playoff hunt. It marks a return to form for the historic rivalry, with significant implications for the NFC North title, as both are fighting for the top seed in the division. The Bears have recently shown strong performances, highlighted by a recent upset win against the Eagles.

Many fans and analysts are excited as both teams enter this game with high stakes, as noted in several discussions on [PackersTalk](https://packerstalk.com/2025/12/02/packers-or-bears-who-are-the-kings-of-the-nfc-north-packers-weekly-123). Both organizations are putting more emphasis on dominance in this classic matchup.

## Christian Watson Emerges as Key Offensive Weapon
Another highlight of late has been [Christian Watson's return](https://packerstalk.com/2025/12/02/christian-watson-is-earning-his-position-as-the-green-bay-packers-top-receiver), further solidifying Love's confidence on the field. Since coming back from injury, Watson has played a central role in the offense, leading in receiving yards and touchdowns, proving himself as the Packers' top receiver.

## Coaching and Strategy Insights
Coach Matt LaFleur's aggressive game plan against the Lions included successfully converting on multiple fourth down tries, a key element of their recent success ([Packers Therapy](https://packerstalk.com/2025/12/02/lafleur-kicks-campbells-can-packers-therapy-494)). This strategy will be pivotal when facing the Bears' formidable running attack led by D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, especially following an injury to Wyatt that has left a gap in the defensive line.

## Week Ahead: Game Preview
Looking ahead to their Week 14 clash, the success of the Packers will largely depend on their ability to manage the Bears' run game and maintain control of the clock. As Coach LaFleur noted, players must step up, particularly on defense, to counter the Bears' offensive strategies effectively. Expect Lambeau to be electric as the Packers aim to reassert their dominance over their oldest rival.

*As the Packers prepare for this heated rivalry matchup and the playoff push, excitement is in the air! Can they continue their winning momentum? Stay tuned for what promises to be an intense game on December 7!*
