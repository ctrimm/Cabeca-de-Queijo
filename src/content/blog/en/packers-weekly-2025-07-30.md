## 1. **Injury Updates: MarShawn Lloyd and Christian Watson**
Injuries continue to plague the team, with running back MarShawn Lloyd facing a setback due to a non-contact groin injury sustained during practice. Coach Matt LaFleur referred to it as "unfortunate" given Lloyd's previous medical struggles, but teammate Josh Jacobs expressed optimism, stating, "He’s going to be alright, man" ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers/comments/1mclfoi/josh_jacobs_on_marshawn_lloyds_groin_injury_hes/)). Meanwhile, wide receiver Christian Watson remains on the PUP list and is expected to miss considerable time as he recovers from an ACL tear ([source](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/2025/7/30/24476922/green-bay-packers-53-man-roster-prediction-after-1-week-of-training-camp-depth-chart-update-2025)).

## 2. **Elgton Jenkins Returns**
Star offensive lineman Elgton Jenkins has returned from the NFI list and participated in practice on a limited basis.
