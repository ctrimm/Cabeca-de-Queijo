As we wrap up this week's action surrounding the Green Bay Packers, it’s been a wild few days filled with both excitement and uncertainty. Let’s dive into what’s been happening in Packerland!

#### **Jaire Alexander's Departure**
The biggest news is undoubtedly the release of Pro Bowl cornerback **Jaire Alexander** on June 12. Much speculation surrounded his contract situation, but reports from his father suggest that the Packers were unwilling to guarantee any money for 2025, leading to this drastic move. This decision has left a void in an already-thin secondary. The front office will have to lean heavily on newcomers like **Nate Hobbs** and returning players such as **Keisean Nixon** to step up in his absence.

#### **Changes in the Center Position**
With Alexander gone and other changes afoot, the Packers are also adjusting on the offensive line. **Elgton Jenkins** is transitioning back to center, replacing **Josh Myers**, who has signed with the New York Jets. Jenkins has proven versatile throughout his career, making this move a heads-up strategy by the coaching staff. This shift reflects the team's current focus on maximizing their offensive line’s potential while also addressing depth concerns without forsaking quality.

#### **Compensatory Picks Update**
The outlook for the Packers' future draft picks was clarified this week as they will not receive any compensatory picks in 2026 due to their significant investments in free agency this season, including deals for **Aaron Banks** and **Nate Hobbs**. This may complicate future roster decisions and player acquisitions should they not hit the mark this year.

#### **Funding the Future: Salary Cap Decisions**
The Packers currently hold a sturdy $35 million in salary cap space, but how they will utilize this remains a question. The team is expected to prioritize extending contracts for key players like **Zach Tom**, creating further discussion around how to best allocate resources for current and future talent needs.

#### **Isaiah Simmons' New Role**
New linebacker **Isaiah Simmons** has expressed optimism about his fresh start in Green Bay after struggling in previous seasons. Simmons has stated that the streamlined focus on playing linebacker, along with support from defensive coordinator **Jeff Hafley**, may rediscover the potential that made him a top draft pick. The team hopes Simmons can finally fulfill expectations and offer support to a young defensive lineup.

#### **Depth Wide Receivers Shine in OTAs**
With receiver **Christian Watson** recovering from knee surgery, the depth players are taking advantage of their chances. New acquisition **Mecole Hardman** has made notable plays, including a highlight reel 74-yard touchdown, while **Cornelius Johnson** has also emerged as a player to watch during OTAs. This competition could reshape the receiving corps and determine roster spots come the regular season.
