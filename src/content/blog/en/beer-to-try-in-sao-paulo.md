**Note** - As far as we know, there is not much in terms of a craft brewery or tap house near the Corinthians Stadium. Your best bet will be to snag a Brahma or Original from the street vendors outside the stadium or wait until you're inside to imbibe.

# Top Beers To Try While in Brazil for the NFL Sao Paulo Game

[If you need help ordering a beer, checkout our 2 minute guide here](/blog/how-to-order-a-beer-in-portuguese/).

There are of course the favorites - an `estupida gelada chopp` - or, a stupidly cold beer. These chopps are traditionally lighter, pilsner or lager styled beers that you can get much anywhere in the city. There are a few major Brazilian breweries - Brahma, Antarctica Original (my favorite), Skol, Itaipava, and others - that create this style. And, you can typically get it in a ~10 ounce pour for a couple of dollars (anything more is highway robbery).

Think of this chopp beer as your "go-to". The old stand-by. The friend that never lets you down. Great for beach days, at a churrascaria (BBQ), a lunch beer, and so much more in between.

From [an old post on HomeBrewTalk](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/brazilian-chopp-beer.121966/), a poster, `erik2113` stated that a Chopp is - 
> The pour on the chopp is very specific as well to create the head that keeps a barrier between oxygen and the beer which keeps it from turning bad while you drink it.

However, over the past few years, there has been a massive increase in the creation of an expansion of Brazilian Craft Breweries or Cervejarias.

The next step up from a chopp beer would be Eisenbahn,  Cerverjaria Colorado, or Black Princess. These two make a few different styles, but are nothing noteworthy. These beers typically run a couple US Dollars at the Oxxo convenient store or at the supermarket. They're good, but not great.

We'll move right onto the Craft Beer level - or Cervejas Artesanal - can be about $5 USD to $8 USD depending where you go. The styles can either be a bit underwhelming or ALL-IN. Think of something as polarizing as a Rauchbier - there are some cervejarias that only have a touch of smoked malts or they go all in and it feels like you've just ripped a carton of cigs. This hold true across all other styles.
