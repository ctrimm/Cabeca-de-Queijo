As we transition into the summer, the Green Bay Packers have had a busy week filled with major news and intriguing developments. Here’s a recap of the most important stories coming out of Packers nation this week:

## Jaire Alexander Released

In a surprising move, the Packers officially released Pro Bowl cornerback [Jaire Alexander](https://cheeseheadtv.com/blog/packers-releasing-cb-jaire-alexander-124) on June 9, 2025. The decision comes after Alexander’s struggles with injury, having only played in 14 games over the past two seasons. The Packers were unable to reach an agreement on a restructured contract, prompting the release which frees up over $17 million in cap space. General Manager Brian Gutekunst acknowledged Alexander's contributions during his tenure but highlighted the need for availability and consistency moving forward ([Packers Talk](https://packerstalk.com/2025/06/09/packers-releasing-pro-bowl-defender-on-monday/)). 

### What’s Next?
The Packers will absorb about $7.5 million of dead money this year, easing their cap issues for 2026, leaving them poised for upcoming acquisitions ([Acme Packing Company](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/2025/6/10/24446812/packers-will-take-on-all-of-jaire-alexanders-dead-money-on-2025-salary-cap-per-report)). Several teams are already interested in Alexander as a free agent, with media speculation circling around the possibility of him joining the NFC North rivals ([Cold Wire](https://www.thecoldwire.com/latest-odds-show-betting-favorites-to-land-jaire-alexander/)).
