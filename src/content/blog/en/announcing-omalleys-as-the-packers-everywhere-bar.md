# ðŸš¨ Announcing O'Malley's As [the Packers Everywhere Bar](https://www.packerseverywhere.com/find-a-bar/bar-details/Index?id=dade858a-fa8f-6ce3-be09-ff000095b832) in SÃ£o Paulo ðŸš¨
With the NFL coming to SÃ£o Paulo **next week** - there is no better time than the present to announce O'Malley's being **the location** to watch all [Green Bay Packers](https://packers.com) games for the 2024 to 2025 season.

Over the past year or so, we've been in communication with the manager at [O'Malley's](https://www.omalleysbar.net/) after watching the Packers take on the Steelers in November of 2023. Quite possibly the game where Jordan Love started to R-E-L-A-X and let loose a bit (at least in the last 2 min drive).

The process to get a location secured was **two steps** - 
1. Establish [CabeÃ§a de Queijo](https://cabecadequeijo.com) as a Braizlian Packer Backer Fan Club with [PackersEverywhere.com](https://packerseverywhere.com)
2. Translate the requirements to become an official watch location for Green Bay games with [O'Malley's](https://www.omalleysbar.net/)

This process above was rather straight forward since we have this lovely website, some stickers, and even a [WhatsApp group](/chapters/sao-paulo/) to communicate with other fans.

We are still very much a small operation, we encourage Packers fans to [read more on our blog](/blog/), visit our friends at [Packers.br](https://www.packersbrasil.com.br/), and help spread the love of the game.
