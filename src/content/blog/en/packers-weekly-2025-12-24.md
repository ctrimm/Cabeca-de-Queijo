## **Injury Reports Raise Concerns**
### **Jordan Love and Malik Willis Update**
On December 23, both [Jordan Love](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/green-bay-packers-news/77083/packers-injury-report-jordan-love-malik-willis-participate-in-walkthrough) and Malik Willis participated in walkthrough drills, though both were termed as limited participants. Love left the game against the Bears with a concussion, and Willis noted he also sustained a shoulder injury during the match. Meanwhile, the team's overall injury report revealed 19 players, including RT Zach Tom and LB Kristian Welch, who both did not participate.

As the Packers prepare for the Ravens, the QB situation remains crucial for their playoff aspirations. There’s speculation around the potential of third-string quarterback Clayton Tune stepping in should both Love and Willis be unable to play.

## **Crisis Mode: Can the Packers Clinch a Playoff Berth?**
### **Facing Baltimore with High Stakes**
Looking ahead, fans are curious if the Packers can rebound against the Ravens. With a playoff berth still on the line—an outcome that’s within reach if they can secure at least one win in their final two games or rely on the Detroit Lions faltering—the pressure is palpable. As explained in [this discussion](https://packerstalk.com/2025/12/23/can-the-packers-recover-from-the-bears-loss-clinch-a-playoff-berth-no-huddle-radio-250/), the team needs to quickly regain focus and capitalize on every opportunity, particularly in the red zone where they have struggled consistently.

## **Fan Reactions: Airing of Grievances**
### **Packers Discussion: Festivus Edition**
To cope with the disappointing losses, fans engaged in a Festivus celebration on [Acme Packing Company](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/green-bay-packers-discussion/77008/packers-discussion-air-your-grievances-for-festivus).

## **Roster Moves: Activations and Plans**
### **Tight End Situation**
With John FitzPatrick's unfortunate Achilles injury leaving only Luke Musgrave healthy at the tight end position, the Packers made a significant roster move by activating DE Collin Oliver from the PUP list. The reliance on a two-TE set in the Packers’ system might force them to add another player as they prepare for the Ravens following FitzPatrick’s injury.
