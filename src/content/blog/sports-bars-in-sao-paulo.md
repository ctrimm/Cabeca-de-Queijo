## Going to a Sports Bar
For some reason or another, finding a place like Buffalo Wild Wings is pretty difficult in Brazil. Typically, soccer matches between clubs are played on small TV's at the corner botecas. Fans used to gather at Applebee's but, it appears that most locations in S達o Paulo have closed. However, there is also the American Staple - [TGI Fridays](https://www.google.com/maps/search/TGI+Fridays/@-23.6011142,-46.6829626,14z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu), but they're typically in shopping malls. We cannot speak from experience, but that seems like a bit of a different vibe for watching an NFL game...

Here is a short list of bars in S達o Paulo that we know of with TV's that will play the NFL.

- [O'Malley's](https://www.omalleysbar.net/) - _typically __PACKED__ with NFL fans every game day_
- [Goose Island Brewery S達o Paulo](https://www.instagram.com/gooseislandsp/)
- [Flames Tap House](https://www.instagram.com/flamestaphouse/)

My one piece of advice is to reach out to the bar on Instagram or via What'sApp to confirm that they will have the game you are looking for. It's happened a couple times where we have gone to a "sports bar" only to find that they did not have the game on.
