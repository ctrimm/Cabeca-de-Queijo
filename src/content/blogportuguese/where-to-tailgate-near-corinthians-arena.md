## Quick Intro
Corinthians Arena is typically home to a different kind of football. However for the first time in over 50+ years, the National Football League (NFL) will be hosting an American Football match - the first of it's kind in South America - between the Green Bay Packers and the Philadelphia Eagles. Corinthians Arena typically has "camarote" or VIP sections in the southern end of the stadium that has good food and drink typically 2 hours before and after the game ends. Now, if you don't live in São Paulo, you may not know where to tailgate prior to the game.

Corinthians Stadium is located in the Eastern part of the city - nearly 40 minutes away from [Ibirapuera Park](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ibirapuera_Park).
